# Currency Conversion System

A **Java console-based currency conversion system** demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  
This project was developed as part of an academic assignment to apply concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, abstraction, and modularity to a real-world financial problem.

---

##  Project Overview
- Provides a **menu-driven console interface** for currency conversion.
- Supports multiple international currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, CHF, CNY, JPY, INR.
- Uses **predefined static exchange rates** for offline functionality.
- Demonstrates **OOP concepts**:
  - Classes & Objects
  - Constructors
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
  - Modular methods

## CURRENCY CONVERSION SYSTEM

Currency Converter Menu
1. List all currencies
2. Convert currency
3. Exit

Choose an option: 2
Select source currency: USD
Select target currency: INR
Enter the USD value you want to change to INR: 1

1.0 USD = 83.5 INR

##  Future Integration
- Integration with **real-time exchange rate APIs** for live conversions.
- Development of a **graphical user interface (GUI)** for better user experience.
- Implementation of **collaborative filtering** to recommend frequently used currency pairs.
- Expansion to include **more currencies** and advanced financial tools.
